# Angular for backend developers

Welcome to Angular for backend developers tutorial. This tutorial contains exercises from the Angular
for backend developers workshop. You can go through this tutorial and build the "Morning coffee"
application once again yourself.

## How to use this tutorial

You will be given instructions here. On the right side you have a small IDE in which you can do your
changes. Ok, it's not full IDE, it's just code editor with some code highlighting, terminal and
a small preview of your application.

Try to build the solution yourself based on your knowledge from the workshop. If you get lost, you
can click "Show solution" button which will show you the suggested solution.

And most importantly have fun! Happy coding!
