# Angular for backend developers

Welcome to Angular for backend developers tutorial. This tutorial contains exercises from the Angular
for backend developers workshop. You can go through this tutorial and build the "Morning coffee"
application once again by yourself.

## How to use this tutorial

You will be given instructions here. On the right side you have a small IDE in which you can do your
changes. Ok, it's not full IDE, it's just code editor with some code highlighting, terminal and
a small preview of your application.

Try to build the solution yourself based on your knowledge from the workshop. Update the files and
hit the "Play" button. Your preview will be refreshed automagically. If you don't believe the result
trey to click the "Refresh" button.

You will always get some information given what should be done and what Angular feature is the step
focused on. Then there will be step by step tutorial. Try to do it without the step by step first.
When you finish the step and go to the next step, all your changes will be updated to the proposed
solution, so when you are really lost, just go to the next step, look at the code and then go back
and try to rebuild it by yourself.

And most importantly have fun! Happy coding!
