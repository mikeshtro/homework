# Start Angular application

To start any Angular application you need to install all npm dependencies first. Write `npm install`
into the console. This takes some time.

When everything is installed, you can start your application. Note that in local setup you don't
need to reinstall the packages unless package.lock file is changed.

You can start your application by writing `npm run start`. This will build you application and serve
it in development mode. See the changes in the right window.

Now try to update the component in the editor. You can see the application is reloaded on each save.
