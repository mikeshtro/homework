# Angular for backend developers

This tutorial contains exercises from Angular for backend developers workshop. You can go through
the "Morning coffee" application once again and try to build it by yourself.

On the right side of the window you can see an editor, a terminal and a preview of the application.
The preview will be updated when you do changes in editor and/or terminal.
